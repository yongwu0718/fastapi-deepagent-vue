# Include HTTP headers in server logs

By default, the Agent Server omits HTTP headers from server logs for privacy reasons. However, logging request and correlation IDs can help you debug issues and trace requests across distributed systems. You can opt-in to logging headers for all API calls by modifying the `logging_headers` section in your `langgraph.json` file.

```json 
  "$schema": "https://langgra.ph/schema.json",
  "http": {
    "logging_headers": {
      "includes": ["request-id", "x-purchase-id", "*-trace-*"],
      "excludes": ["authorization", "x-api-key", "x-organization-id", "x-user-id"]
    }
  }
}
```

The `includes` and `excludes` lists accept exact header names or glob patterns using `*` as a wildcard to match any number of characters (case-insensitive). For your security, no other pattern types are supported.

Note that exclusions take precedence over inclusions. For example, if you include `*-id` but exclude `x-user-id`, the `x-user-id` header will not be logged.
